# TropicalPolyhedron

TropicalPolyhedron is a library for dealing with tropical polyhedrons. Currently, only the external representation is implemented.

## Recall
---

A tropical polyhedron is defined externally by a set of $r$ constraints of the form :

$$A \cdot x + B \leq C \cdot x + D$$

where $x \in \mathbb{R}^d_{\max};\  A,\  C \in \mathbb{R}^{r\times d}_{\max}; \ B, \ D \in \mathbb{R}^{r}_{\max}$.

## Usage
---

The structure of such polyhedrons is given below : 

```
struct TropicalPolyhedron{T<:Real}
    A::Vector{Vector{T}}
    B::Vector{T}
    C::Vector{Vector{T}}
    D::Vector{T}
end
```

To create an empty tropical polyhedron `tpoly`, just write :

```
tpoly = TropicalPolyhedron()
```

If you already have the 4 components of the inequalities :

```
tpoly = TropicalPolyhedron(A, B, C, D)
```

To add a constraint :

```
#=
    a::Vector{T}
    b::T
    c::Vector{T}
    d::T
=#
add_constraint!(tpoly, a, b, c, d)
```
